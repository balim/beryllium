  Scenario: Redis Steps for Key/Value
  Given I have the redis key "key1" with value "value1"
  Given I have the redis key "key2" with value in file "responses/value2.text"
  Given I have the redis key "key3" with value:
  """
  value3

  """
  Given I have the redis key "key4" with value "value4" with ttl 5 seconds
  Then the redis key "key4" should be "value4"
  Then the redis key "key3" should exists
  Then the redis keys "key1,key2,key3" should exists
  Then the redis keys should exists:
  | key1 |
  | key2 |
  | key3 |
  Then the redis key "key4" should not exists after 6 seconds
  Then the redis key "key4" should not exists
  Then the redis keys "key100,key200,key300" should not exists
  Then the redis key "key1" should be "value1"
  Then the redis key "key2" should be:
  """
  value2

  """
  Then the redis key "key3" should be file "responses/value3.text"

  Scenario: Redis Steps for Key/Value With DB
  Given I have the redis key "key1" in the db 1 with value "value1"
  Given I have the redis key "key2" in the db 1 with value in file "responses/value2.text"
  Given I have the redis key "key3" in the db 3 with value:
  """
  value3

  """
  Given I have the redis key "key4" in the db 4 with value "value4" with ttl 5 seconds
  Then the redis key "key4" in the db 4 should be "value4"
  Then the redis key "key3" in the db 3 should exists
  Then the redis keys "key1,key2" in the db 1 should exists
  Then the redis keys in the db 1 should exists:
  | key1 |
  | key2 |
  Then the redis key "key4" in the db 4 should not exists after 6 seconds
  Then the redis key "key4" in the db 4 should not exists
  Then the redis keys "key100,key200,key300" in the db 1 should not exists
  Then the redis key "key1" in the db 1 should be "value1"
  Then the redis key "key2" in the db 1 should be:
  """
  value2

  """
  Then the redis key "key3" in the db 3 should be file "responses/value3.text"

  Scenario: Redis Steps for Lists
  Given I have the redis list "list1" with values "value1"

  | value3   |
  | value33  |
  | value333 |
  Given I have the redis list "list4" with values "value4" with ttl 5 seconds
  Given I have the redis list "list5" with values "value5,value55,value555" with ttl 5 seconds
  Then the redis list "list4" should be "value4"
  Then the redis list "list5" should be "value5,value55,value555"
  Given I have the redis list "list6" with values "value6,value66,value666"
  Then the redis list "list6" should be:
  | value6   |
  | value66  |
  | value666 |
  Then the redis list "list3" should exists
  Then the redis lists "list1,list2,list3" should exists
  Then the redis lists should exists:
  | list1 |
  | list2 |
  | list3 |
  Then the redis list "list5" should not exists after 6 seconds
  Then the redis list "list4" should not exists
  Then the redis lists "list100,list200,list300" should not exists
  Given I have the redis list "list7" with values "value7,value77,value777"
  Then the redis list "list7" should be file "responses/list7.text"

  Scenario: Redis Steps for Lists
  Given I have the redis list "list1" in the db 1 with values "value1"
  Given I have the redis list "list1.2" in the db 1 with values "value1.2"

  Then the redis list "list4" in the db 4 should not exists
  Then the redis lists "list100,list200,list300" in the db 1 should not exists
  Given I have the redis list "list7" in the db 7 with values "value7,value77,value777"
  Then the redis list "list7" in the db 7 should be file "responses/list7.text"
